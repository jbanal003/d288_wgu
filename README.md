Back-End Application Programming

A travel agency has recently launched a complete overhaul of their front-end vacation bookings application
using Angular and JavaScript. Lately, the front-end engineers have encountered various undocumented bugs
when sending requests and fetching data from the back-end. Since the back-end was built in the early 1990s
and the original developer has since retired and can no longer help troubleshoot, the existing team is
concerned about the growing tech debt and lack of ongoing support. Your chief technology officer (CTO)
decided to create a project to port over any mission-critical functionalities to a modern framework and has
selected you, a software developer in Java, to start developing the minimally viable product (MVP) to migrate
the legacy back-end to the modern Spring framework.
